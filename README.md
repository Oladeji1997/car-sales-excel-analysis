# Car Sales Dashboard Analysis (Excel)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Excel dashboard built to analyze car sales performance, pricing, resale value, retention, and vehicle performance metrics across multiple car models. The goal is to support business decision-making by comparing models across sales, customer retention, and performance factors.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Charts (Column, Doughnut, Bar)
- Slicers for interactivity
- Conditional Formatting

## 📁 Dataset
Car sales dataset sourced from Kaggle containing:
- Manufacturer
- Model
- Unit Sales
- Price
- Year Resale Value
- Retention Percentage
- Engine Size
- Horsepower
- Fuel Efficiency

Additional calculated fields were created for:
- Retention category (GOOD / POOR)
- Power Performance Factor

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

### 1. Sales Performance Analysis
- Analyzed **unit sales by car model** using doughnut charts to compare market demand.
- Used slicers to dynamically filter performance by selected vehicle models.

### 2. Pricing and Resale Value Comparison
- Compared **average price vs year resale value** across models using clustered column charts.
- Identified models with stronger resale retention relative to purchase price.

### 3. Customer Retention Evaluation
- Visualized **retention percentage by model** using pie charts.
- Applied conditional labels (GOOD / POOR) to highlight retention risk.

### 4. Vehicle Performance Assessment
- Calculated and visualized a **Power Performance Factor** based on horsepower and engine size.
- Compared performance across models using bar charts.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Some high-selling models also show strong retention and resale value, indicating better long-term customer value.
- Certain models exhibit high power performance but lower retention, suggesting possible cost or reliability concerns.
- Models with lower resale value tend to have weaker retention categories.
- Interactive filtering allows quick comparison of performance trade-offs between models.
